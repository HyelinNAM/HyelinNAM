## Hi There ðŸ‘‹  

### Hello, I'm Hyelin Nam!

Good day! I'm MS student in BISPL(under the supervision of Prof. Jong Chul Ye), KAIST.

My recent research focuses on diffusion models, investigating methods to **(1) enhance controllability within their sampling processes**, and **(2) exploit their intermediate representations**. Recently, I'm working on **(3) multi-modal representation learning** as well. I believe that this line of inquiry, aimed at understanding data distribution, is a crucial step towards achieving general AI.

For more information, please refer my [CV](https://github.com/HyelinNAM/HyelinNAM/blob/main/CV.pdf) and feel free to reach out to me at <hyelin.nam@kaist.ac.kr>.
